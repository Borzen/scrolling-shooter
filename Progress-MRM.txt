Stardate 66168.4:
-----------------
-MatthewMcHaney merged completely (1 & 2)

-Added jzavala 1 and 2.
-Added xrt1986 1 and 2.
-Khrijunk 1 and 2.
-Borzen 1 and 2.
-zutsori 1 and 2.
-jshaw2 1 and 2.
-nstanley 1 and 2. (doesn't seem to implement freezewave in the playership class. Gonna leave that alone for now. Also grabbed a few references to his next lava enemy)
-malinajirka 1 and 2. (modified by making a new enum projectile value: enemybomb)

Stardate 66171.1:
-----------------
-dkellycollins 1 and 2. (bubblebullet is set to an empty square, is invisible)
-drymph 1 and 2. (enemy comes from either left or right, so I made 2 enemy types: drillleft and drillright)
-Versaiteis 2 (included files for 1 but no implementation. Enemy AI is also wonky, needs fixing)
-barge5633 2 (didn't include 1 at all)
